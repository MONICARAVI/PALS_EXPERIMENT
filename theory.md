## Function Generator:
  Function Generator is an instrument that can generate common waveforms like triangle, sine, cosine, square, sawtooth, etc., 
  It also provides options for changing the characteristics of the waveforms such as amplitude and frequency.
  It is usually connected with CRO for visualising the waves generated.

## Cathode Ray Oscilloscope - CRO:
  CRO which stands for Cathode Ray Oscilloscope is an electronic instrument used to visualize waveforms.
  In the early days, it is also called an oscillograph. The instrument has four sections namely display, x-axis controls, y-axis controls and triggers.
  CRO is mainly used to analyse the properties of the waveforms.

## Sine wave:
	Sine wave is a periodic wave defined by the function 
*y = sin(x)*
	
## Cosine wave:
	Cosine wave is also a periodic wave defined by a function 
*y=cos(x)*
