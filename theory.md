## Function Generator:
  Function Generator is an instrument that can generate common waveforms like triangle, sine, cosine, square, sawtooth, etc., 
  It also provides options for changing the characteristics of the waveforms such as amplitude and frequency.
  The wave generated is available at the output jack. It can be visualised by connecting it to the CRO.

## Cathode Ray Oscilloscope - CRO:
  CRO which stands for Cathode Ray Oscilloscope is an electronic instrument used to visualize waveforms.
  In the early days, it is also called an oscillograph. The instrument has four sections namely display, x-axis controls, y-axis controls and triggers.
  CRO is mainly used to analyse the properties of the waveforms.

## Sine wave:
	Sine wave is a periodic wave defined by the function 
*y = sin(x)*

## Cosine wave:
	Cosine wave is also a periodic wave defined by a function 
*y=cos(x)*

## Square wave:
	Square wave also called pulse wave is a periodic waveform having equal positive and negative pulse width 
	generally called as 50% duty cycle.

## Sawtooth wave:
  The sawtooth wave is a kind of non-sinusoidal waveform. It is so named based on its resemblance to the teeth of a saw. The convention is that a sawtooth wave ramps upward and then sharply drops. However, in a "reverse sawtooth wave", the wave ramps downward and then sharply rises. It can also be considered the extreme case of an asymmetric triangle wave. The piecewise linear function based on the floor function of time t is an example of a sawtooth wave with period 1. A more general form, in the range âˆ’1 to 1, and with period a, is This sawtooth function has the same phase as the sine function.

## Triangular wave:
  Triangular waves are a periodic, non-sinusoidal waveform with a triangular shape. People often get confused between the triangle and sawtooth waves. The most important feature of a triangular wave is that it has equal rise and fall times. To generate triangular waves we need an input wave. In this project, we are using square waves for input. Like triangular waves, square waves have equal rise and fall times so they are more convenient to be converted to a triangular waveform.
  In a triangle waveform, voltage increases gradually along a straight line to its maximum value, and then gradually decreases along a straight line to its lowest value, and then starts increasing again.  
  The triangular wave is generated by repeatedly charging and discharging a capacitor from a constant current source. This produces a linearly ascending and descending voltage ramp.
