## Introduction:
Warm Welcome to the Basic Engineering Practices Laboratory. It a core course in all Electronics and Electrical undergraduate curricula.
This course is basis for understanding the various types of signals and also on how to operate the instruments or IC to generate those waveforms. 
The interactive experiments in this lab helps the students to learn the concepts effectively and efficiently.
