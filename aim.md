## Aim:
The experiments open up the introduction to types of signal and their representations.
In this experiment, the students can visualize the signal and measure their parameters,namely peak-peak value, RMS value, average value, period, frequency.
They can also analyze the signal behavior using CRO (Cathode Ray Oscilloscope).
## Learning Objectives of the Experiment:
In this experiment, you will be able to do the following:

1. Choose the appropriate type of signal for their requirement
2. Use function generator as a signal source
3. Use CRO (Cathode Ray Oscilloscope) as display and measuring device
4. Handling of Function Generator and CRO
5. Identify and set the appropriate signal in the source and display it in CRO. 
6. Measure the signal parameters
7. Analyse the behavior of the signal based on the measurements done
8. Evaluate the various types of signals based on the analysis done.

## Estimated Time: 1 hour
